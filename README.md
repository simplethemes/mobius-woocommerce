Mobius WooCommerce Child Theme
==================

Demo: http://themes.simplethemes.com/mobius/shop/

This is not a complete child theme package. The contents of this repo represents the files you should add/replace to enable WooCommerce compatibility.

Upload the following files to your currently installed <a href="https://www.simplethemes.com/wordpress-themes/theme/mobius">Mobius</a> child theme:

* woocommerce.css
* woocommerce.php

If this is a new installation, go ahead and replace functions.php as well.

If you've previously modified your Mobius child theme's functions.php, don't overwrite it! Just append the code from functions.php following this comment:
